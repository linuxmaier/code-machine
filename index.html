    <h1 id="headBanner">The Code Machine</h1>
    <p id="explanation">You! Yes you, with the keyboard. You look like you've
    got some secrets to keep. I bet you're tired of using tricks like writting
    backwards, or using light yellow colored pencils. Well, I've got a tool for
    you, then! This here is a genuine <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a> Code
    Machine. I'll even throw in a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">substitution
    cipher</a> in for free. Sound good? Well, pick your shift (or choose random)
    below and then type your secret message into the code box. I'll then show
    you the cipher text, or if you like I'll even email it to your
    conspirator.</p>
    <h2>Happy spying!</h2>
